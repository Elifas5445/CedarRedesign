				<h2>In Detail</h2>
				<h3>what you want to know</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It is thought that B&amp;B's are far more expensive than "regular hotels." The average cost of a decent hotel room in Asheville is $125 per night. This price may not include parking ($10-$15), Wi-Fi ($8-$12), dessert ($5 per person), wine ($6 per glass per person), breakfast ($10 per person). When you add up these extras, it's easy to see that staying at a B&amp;B is often cheaper, and the charm of the home and personal service you recieve is not even comparable.</li>
					<li>The Cedar Crest Inn is a business, sure it's a labor of love but we recognize without you we cannot do what we love. You are not entering our home when you get here, you are paying to be a part of this place and we make sure that translates into your stay. No awkwardness here, you will not be judged, you are free to do as you please. We are always happy to socialize with our guests but we also respect your privacy. We want you to feel comfortable, that means no curfews, no bizarre rules, we provide a comfortable Bed & Breakfast experience.</li>
					<li>We offer an open breakfast schedule. We don't have just one sitting, breakfast is offered throughout the course of an hour. You can sleep in if you want, we understand this is your vacation! We also offer private tables for two with seating both inside and outside, as well as larger family style tables for those looking to socialize with other guests.</li>
					<li>Ladies are you having trouble convincing your man of staying in a pink BnB?We don't deprive you of modern conveniences, all of our rooms have wireless internet and flat screen TV's. Many of the TV's are 32 inches +, no need to miss the big game or your favorite show. Also mention to him Asheville, NC is the #1 micro brew city in America.</li>
					<li>We offer discount Biltmore tickets that give you an extra day for free and our passes are always at least a few dollars cheaper than the gate price.</li>
					<li>Our many awards include: Being voted #1 for Romantic Hotels in Asheville on Tripadvisor. Fodor's Best Inns of the South, 10 Most Romantic Inns in America (Association of Historic Inns), 12 Dream Weekends (Atlanta Magazine), The Top 5 Places to Stay in Asheville, North Carolina (New York Times), and a feature in Inns magazine.</li>

				<h3>The Only B&amp;B in Asheville to get a Celebrity Review?</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<cite>
					I look for aesthetics and attention to detail when selecting an off-the-beaten-path vacation getaway. If the website and the photos convey that impressive quality that I'm always looking for, I know its proprietors have the same sensibilities that are in line with my own. The Cedar Crest Inn in Asheville, NC is a favorite of mine. Stylistically eloquent, comfortable, and one of the most beautiful places I've ever found on earth.

				It feels good that our little Asheville NC bed and breakfast can be so impressive even in the discriminating eyes of a celebrity, a designer no less!
